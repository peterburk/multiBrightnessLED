Multi-Brightness LED Class Materials

During my work at Essmart, I was asked to teach a class on electronics on the 19th of March 2014.

The task was simple:

Design a class to teach 30 people some basic electronic principles in less than 2 hours.

I proposed 3 projects (multi-brightness LED, audio-infrared remote, and AM radio receiver). The multi-brightness LED was accepted! Great – except that was my own idea, not something I found on Instructables. So I had to design the whole project myself!

##Slides

The presentation is all my own work, with circuits designed in Omnigraffle for Mac. Colours are consistent with the wires used.

##Components 
(prices on SP Road, Bangalore - https://bangaloreron.wordpress.com/2013/01/25/where-to-buy-electronic-parts-and-components-in-bangalore-pt-2/ )
• microUSB F connectors x15 (half the class were expected to bring their phone chargers). 20 rupees each ($0.33), 310 INR total with tax ($5.10).
• USB M wires x15 (these were cut from USB M-F extension wires). 18 rupees each ($0.30), 220 INR total with tax ($3.61).
• LED, 3V voltage drop, 20mA current x30
• 100Ω current-limiting resistor x30
• 4.7kΩ resistors x60 (each person got 2 for series or parallel)
• 4.7kΩ variable resistor x30
• Switch x30
• Coloured 1 metre wires x5 (red, black, blue, green, yellow)
• Terminal block or barrier strip, 6 holes per person (cheaper than breadboard, no soldering for class).
• Soldering iron x1 (to attach wires to variable resistor, switch). 170 rupees ($2.79).
• Solder x1 (to attach and tin wires)
• Hot glue x1 (to strengthen microUSB connections)
• Glue gun x1 (I used a hair dryer, but it was much more tedious)
• Swiss Army Knife scissors (for stripping wires)
• Screwdrivers
• Red and black markers pens to label terminal block positions, LED legs.

##Cost
Under 1500 rupees ($25) for everything.

##Benefits
+ Class uses screwdrivers on terminal block instead of breadboard or soldering irons. It’s cheap, easy to repair, and less dangerous.
+ Colouring the LED legs made training much easier.
+ Colouring the terminal blocks was helpful, though more colours could make it even easier. Numbering holes for colourblind users could be better.
+ Using standard phone chargers or USB as a power source is much easier than batteries.
+ Components are cheap enough for class to take their circuits away at the end.
+ Excellent feedback from class and managers.

##Problems
– Only one person brought microUSB M phone charger as asked
– Not enough hot glue made microUSB F to power very weak: 4 of them broke during demo.
– Hair dryer much slower than glue gun; buy one next time.
– Cutting the wires using Swiss Army Knife scissors while riding in a car along 14 hairpin bends on the way to Kodaikanal, in the dark, was an experience. I even did it with my eyes shut!
– It is impossible to regain the attention of the class once components are in their hands. Give out components only after finishing the theory slides!
